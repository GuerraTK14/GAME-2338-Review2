I give this game 4 star rating because I think it would be better if it had more side quests missions to keep the game going.  
## Summary

First we have a young man named cole who was delivering a package on a regular day for work until the box started to glow and before he knew it exploded. Then cole was in a coma for a few weeks and when he awoke his hands started to spark of electricity making cole very worried of what happened to him. A week later went by living in City called Metropolis and it has gone to lock down by a government making sure that things stay in order ever since the massive explosion. Cole didn’t like the way things turned out in the city so he started to make changes to the town to see if he could make it better and during that he had moments to hone his electricity powers.

Eventually in the game we find out that he wasn’t the only one who got powers and they were over powering the people in the city. With the city going to chaos the government sends in special forces to handle the criminals. Cole was talked to about how to help him and the city by being their messenger boy. 

Throughout the game there are some choices for the player to choose and it will cole to be a hero that people from danger or a villain that kills or drains anyone no matter who. When you make those choices the city starts to see you differently, as a hero you capture the enemies and the police helps or being nice towards you while the villain kills his enemy and gets more power than usual. The choices are there to see which one you would favor and to make the game unique for different story ending.  

 

## Final Thoughts

I think Infamous is a fantastic game to play because you're able to get from place to place by riding on power lines in the city and glide down on your enemies. To strike down multiple enemies with lighting for the sky and throw blast grenades that will send even a car flying. I just really love how they made a character the such vast powers and how power the enemies must be to defeat.
